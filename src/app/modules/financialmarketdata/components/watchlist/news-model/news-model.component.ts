Analysts largely expect a 50-bps hike, but the possibility of a 75-bps raise has also grown after Friday's higher-than-expected US CPI data. Locally, the RBI last week raised its key interest rate by 50 bps to curb high inflation. The country's wholesale annual inflation surged 15.88% in May, while retail inflation eased to 7.04%. Energy stocks fell after gaining recently. In contrast, Network18 Media climbed 2.5% after Viacom18, in which Network 18 owns a majority stake, won digital streaming rights for the Indian cricket league IPL from 2023 to 2027.

On the domestic front, the Reserve Bank of India also raised the key interest rate by 50 bps in June, after a surprise 40bps off cycle rate-hike in May and tracking most other central banks. However, the central bank’s verbal pledge to support a record USD 183 billion government-borrowing plan hasn’t been backed by actions so far. The monetary authority has refrained from implementing any steps such as direct purchases unlike last year, which is set to cause a even deeper selloff in the bond market.",

The agency further added that conditions in the financial sector, that were a key growth impediment before the pandemic, have improved in recent years. However, Fitch reaffirmed its credit rating at BBB- as it expects the South-east nation’s GDP growth to slow to 7.8% in FY 2022-23, from 8.5% projected earlier as high commodity prices are set to dampen some of the growth momentum. Further, fiscal deficit is expected to rise to 6.8% of GDP, compared with budgetary estimate of 6.4% and inflation to remain elevated at 6.9%, up 0.2% than RBI’s projection, due to the sharp rise in global commodity prices and underlying demand pressures.",

Multiple districts in Beijing are shutting down entertainment venues, while most residents in Shanghai are facing new rounds of mass testing.

The latest figure also marked the 10th straight month of growth in services activity, buoyed by a substantial pick-up in new business growth as demand continued to recover following the reopening of the economy after COVID-19 lockdowns. Meanwhile, foreign demand declined in each month since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 amid mounting global uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and persistent supply chain issues.. At the same time, employment fell marginally, with backlogs of work expanding for the 5th straight month and  the fastest in a year. On the price front, input price inflation accelerated to the highest in 16-1/2 years on a higher food, fuel, labor, raw material, and transport costs.  In turn, output cost inflation hit the second-highest in near five years. Looking ahead, sentiment remained subdued as  concerns lingered over inflationary pressures.",

Among individual stocks, Reliance surged almost 3%, while TCS and HDFC gained 1% and 0.4%, each.

Meantime, Reuters said that global private equity firm General Atlantic plans to invest $2 billion into India and Southeast Asia over the next two years after falling valuations made the region's startups more attractive. Separately, India's Paytm Payments Bank reportedly expects the central bank to allow it to resume taking on new customers in the next few months. Gains were mainly led by the automotive sector while a sharp selloff was seen for metal stocks. Among single shares, Ashok Leyland surged almost 6%, while Maruti Suzuki soared 4.3%, and Tata Motors gained 1.7%. In contrast, Tata Steel, and Jindal Steel slumped 11.7% and 16.2%, each.",

Locally, the Reserve Bank of India Wednesday surprisingly raised the repo rate and the CRR in an emergency meeting. On business news, Reuters said Central Bank of India plans to shut 13% of its branches to improve its financial health. Meantime, domestic media reported that Mahindra Group has begun a restructuring process to split its automobiles business into 3 separate units. All major sectors were trading lower,  with the metal, auto, and finance among top losers, down between 1-2%. On individual stocks, Bajaj Finance slid 3.7%, while HDFC Bank and Tata Motor shed 2.8% and 3.3%, each. Reliance fell 0.7% ahead of its quarterly results.",

Analysts expect the report will show an 8.5% year-on-year growth in consumer prices, the hottest print since 1981. Domestic inflation data will also be released later in the day, with food prices expected to remain elevated due to supply chain problems related to the Ukraine war. Meantime, shares in Asia slipped, with the Nikkei and the Kospi leading losses, on concerns over more aggressive interest rate hikes from the US Fed. Early losers were Tata Steel (-3.4%), Tata Motors (-3.1%),  ICICI Bank (-1.1%), and Hindalco (-4.7%). Bucking the wider trend, Tata Consultancy Services  gained after reporting higher profit Monday due to large deal signings. The company typically kicks off the earnings season for the IT sector and is often seen as its bellwether.",

On the price front, input price inflation accelerated to the highest since March 2011, on a higher chemical, fuel, raw material, retail, transportation and vegetable prices. Meanwhile, output cost inflation moderated and broadly in line with its long-run average. Looking ahead, business sentiment remained subdued linked to inflation concerns.",

        "description": "India 10Y Bond yield rose to 6.84%, the highest in 2 weeks after the Reserve Bank of India announced to auction USD 112 billion dollars of bonds or 59% of the full year target, in the first half of the fiscal year starting April 1st, in line with past years amid a global bond rout and persisting Russia-Ukraine tensions.  Despite the rise in domestic inflation and potential inflationary pressures from surging crude oil prices, the Reserve Bank of India kept interest rate at a record low of 4% since March 2020 in contrast to hawkish stances by major global central banks including the Fed and the BoE. Meanwhile, traders now await the RBI’s next monetary policy decision due April 8th to gauge how long the RBI continues its accommodative stance amid price pressures and how it can support the bond market, with having limited scope for bond purchases as it soaks up excess liquidity.",

In Asia, major bourses were mixed  after China's financial hub of Shanghai announced a coronavirus lockdown. Bucking the trend, shares of PVR jumped 10% and INOX Leisure soared 20% to a record high after India's two largest multiplex operators said they would merge to create a theater chain with more than 1,500 screens.",

In India, the government announced a record borrowing plan of USD 200 billion from April while its central bank continued to maintain a more dovish than expected monetary policy in contrast to hawkish stances by the major global central banks including the Fed and BoE. With the RBI reassuring a delayed monetary policy normalization, it is unlikely to return to the pandemic-era measures of bond purchases. Last year, the RBI bought 2.2 trillion rupees of debt before stopping its bond-purchase program in October. Meanwhile, India’s economy expanded for the fifth straight quarter to 5.4% during the September-December period of 2021, although it slowed from 8.5% recorded last quarter.",

        "description": "The Indian rupee weakened towards 75.5 tracking a strong US dollar and a surge in crude oil prices as tensions continued to escalate between Russia and Ukraine. Investors rushed towards the safety assets after Russia announced to put its nuclear deterrent forces on high alert in response to the fresh sanctions imposed by the West on Russia. The West cut Russian banks from the SWIFT and the US banned transactions with the Russian central Bank, limiting Russia’s ability to use assets to finance its destabilizing activities. At the same time, global crude oil prices skyrocketed after Putin’s decision, creating an upward pressure on India’s trade deficit and inflation as the country imports two-thirds of its oil needs. Additionally, India’s GDP growth during the September-December period of 2021 slowed to 5.4% from 8.4% recorded in the previous quarter and came in much below the market estimates of 6% rise as Omicron cases and rising global commodity prices hit the economy.",

President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine. Oil prices jumped over 5% in Asia on Monday, with many countries reportedly considering closing their airspace to Russian aircraft. Meantime, India's GDP data is set to be released later in the day. During Q4 2021, the economy likely grew by 6% yoy, slower than the previous two quarters, amid a resurgence of  COVID-19 cases and lingering concerns over a slowdown in global growth. Among top losers were Raghuvansh Agro (-13.5%), Rain Industries (-12.29%), and Garment Mantra Lif (-10.33%).",

President Vladimir Putin ordered the deployment of troops to two pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing them as independent on Monday, drawing the US and European condemnation for the acceleration of the crisis. Traders shrugged off a decline in COVID-19 infections in India, as the country reported 16,051 new cases Monday, compared to more than 300,000 in late January. All sectoral indices were trading in the negative territory, with the bank and IT falling nearly 2%, each. Among individual stocks, Asian Paints sank 2.36%),  followed by IndusInd Bank sank 2.3%, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (-2.2%), Reliance Industries Ltd (-1.6%), Tech Mahindra (-1.46%), and HDFC Corp (-1.33%).",

Food inflation soared for a 4th consecutive month to 5.43%, the highest since October of 2020, with prices of pulses rising 3.02%, vegetables 5.19% and oils and fats 18.7%. Other upward pressure came from cost of fuel and light (9.32%), clothing and footwear (8.84%), miscellaneous (6.55%), housing (3.52%) and pan and tobacco (2.45%). The inflation stayed at the top of the Reserve Bank of India's target of 2%-6% for the first time since June last year, but the central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das recently said such a high figure should not create any panic because it is mostly due a base effect.",

        "description": "The BSE Sensex added 415 points or 0.72% to 58223 in early trade on Wednesday, extending gains from the prior session, after US stocks rebounded Tuesday as solid earnings reports outweighed fears about a rapid end to pandemic-era monetary support. Technology and bank stocks drove the gains, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy decision on Thursday. The central bank is expected to hold its repo rate steady, but increase its reverse repo rate as part of a process to reduce surplus liquidity poured into markets earlier in the pandemic. Meantime, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday defended his government's efforts to fight the COVID-19, saying they led to high economic growth and middling inflation, unlike the situation in some advanced economies. The country's GDP growth is projected at 9.2% in the current FY ending in March and at 8% to 8.5% the next, while retail inflation hovers around 5.5%, well within the central bank's target of 2- to 6%.",

On Monday, the index finished at a near 11-month high, supported by gains from UltraTech Cement following its upbeat earnings reports.  Markets now await earnings from heavyweight Bajaj Finance later in the day as the third-quarter earnings season entered its second week.",

Almost all market sectors declined, with notable losses from Tata Motors (-2%), Bajaj Finance (-1.5%), State Bank of India (-1.6%), Zee Entertainment (-1.2%), Medplus Health (-3.5%) and Kotak Mahindra Bank (-2.3%). Meanwhile, technology firms resisted the sell off following a strong overnight finish among Wall Street peers, with gains from HCL Technologies (1.9%), Infosys (0.1%), Birlasoft (0.6%), Tech Mahindra (0.9%), Coforge (0.9%0 and Larsen & Toubro (1.2%).",

Global funds pulled USD 4.2 billion from the domestic equity market and USD 587 million from the bond market this quarter. Also, RBI’s dovish monetary policy in contrast with the hawkish Fed decision, where it signaled as many as three rate hikes in 2022, reduced the INR appeal among investors. At the same time, India showed signs of slowing growth through its record high trade deficit (USD 23 billion) and a higher-than-expected jump in retail prices (14.2 percent vs expected 11.9 percent) last month. This comes at a time when the country's Omicron cases have already reached over 200, casting further doubts on its slowing economic recovery.",

        "description": "The IHS Markit India Services PMI inched down to 58.1 in November of 2021 from 58.4 in October and compared with market expectations of 57.8. This marked the fourth straight month of expansion in the sector, and the second-fastest rise since July 2011. Both output and new orders continued to expand, while employment levels were little-changed. Meanwhile, international sales declined, due to travel restrictions. On the price front, input price inflation accelerated to the second-strongest in almost a decade, due to higher fuel, labour, raw materials, retail, and transportations costs, while output charges rose modestly. Looking ahead, although business sentiment improved to a three-month high, the overall level of positive sentiment was well below its long-run average, amid worries impact of inflationary pressures on the recovery.",

        "description": "The Composite PMI in India went up to 59.2 in November 2021 from 58.7 in the prior month on the back of an acceleration in coronavirus vaccinations and stronger efforts by the government to quicken the domestic economic recovery. The latest reading pointed to the fourth straight month of growth in the private sector and the steepest pace since January 2012, mainly led by robust expansion in services activity.  New orders rose for the fourth month running and at the fastest pace in almost a decade, largely supported by the manufacturing industry. Meantime, employment gained slightly, with rates of expansion being equal among both manufacturers and service providers. On prices, input cost inflation matched that seen in October and was the joint-highest in close to 9-1/2 years; while rates of increase in output prices softened from October's 51-month high. Finally, concerns over inflationary pressures dampened optimism among Indian private sector companies.",

Still, it was the biggest trade deficit on record as imports grew much faster than exports. Imports surged 84.77 percent to USD 56.39 billion, mostly due to purchases of crude oil (199.3 percent), as oil prices roughly doubled in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, exports rose at a much slower 22.63 percent to USD 33.79 billion, mainly driven by sales of coffee (62.6 percent); cashew (49.4 percent); petroleum products (47.9 percent); cotton & handloom products (40.5 percent); engineering goods (36.8 percent); and organic & inorganic chemicals (29.7 percent). On the downside, sales fell significantly for Iron ore (-72.8 percent) and oil meals (-39.1 percent).

Also, India’s September Manufacturing PMI recovered only slightly over the previous month (53.7vs 52.3) pointing to a slower pace of growth. Banks and technology were the main draggers. Among the individual stocks, Bajaj Financial Services fell the most (-3.45%) after leading the gain yesterday, followed by Maruti (-2.39%) after its announcement of expecting October production at 60% of normal level owing to shortage of electronic components. On the week, the BSE Sensex booked a fall of 2.14%, the highest weekly drop since February.",

In the US, meantime, persistent inflation fears and growing expectations that the Fed would tighten policy in coming months sent Wall Street ending sharply lower Thursday, with the S&P 500 suffering its worst month since the COVID-19 emerged. On the corporate front, SoftBank-backed Indian hotel aggregator Oyo filed for a $1.14 billion IPO today, the first hospitality company in India to seek a domestic stock listing since 2019.

Gains were driven mainly by banks, capital goods and auto stocks. Banking stocks surged ahead of the Finance Minister’s expected announcement later this evening, of providing sovereign guarantee for the bad banks. Investors morale was also boosted by an increasing pace of vaccinations and yesterday’s government’s reform package for telecom and auto sector. Moreover, investors rejoiced as the country's national bank, SBI, cut home loan interest rate to 6.7%, giving incentives additionally to the non-salaried borrowers. Among the individual stocks, IndusInd Bank led the gain (+7.34%), just like yesterday whereas Tata Consulting Services (TCS) lost (-1.32%) the most.",

        "description": "India's rupee was little-changed at 73.5 against the greenback in mid-September, after Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael Patra said inflation in the country is likely to ease only gradually and that the future course of monetary policy will depend on the outlook on growth and inflation. These remarks came in as India's annual retail price inflation rate eased for a third straight month in August by more than expected, remaining within the RBI's 2-6% target range for the second month in a row and potentially easing pressure for normalization of ultra-loose monetary policy. At the same time, the RBI said earlier this month it was \"quite optimistic\" about its 9.5% GDP growth estimate coming true for FY22. Elsewhere, concerns over early tapering by the US Fed eased amid signs of easing inflationary pressure in the world's largest economy.",

In August, the Reserve Bank of India held interest rates at record-low levels, but raised its inflation forecasts for FY22 while saying it would normalize liquidity conditions.

On the economic data front, India's economy expanded by a record 20.1% in April-June, slightly above market expectations, while retail inflation eased to 5.59% in July, falling within the central bank's 2-6% target range for the first time since April.",

At the same time, employment slipped back into contractionary in August, after growing in July for the first time in 16 months, with backlogs declined at a slight pace. Prices data showed input cost inflation eased, while output cost inflation accelerated to a three-month high, but was below that seen for input costs.

Meantime, a preliminary estimate showed US corporate profits jumping 9.7% to a record high in Q2, due to solid demand and higher prices. On the COVID-19 side, India has asked the states of Kerala and Maharasthra to consider curfews in areas with high virus cases as the country saw over 40,000 new infections for two days in a row today. Budget airline SpiceJet added 2% after India's air safety regulator cleared Boeing's 737 MAX Aircraft to fly starting from Thursday.

        "description": "The S&P BSE Sensex closed slightly up at 52,976 at the end of a volatile session on Friday, driven by gains in IT stocks and a stellar debut by food delivery startup Zomato, which ended 65% above its offer price at INR 125.2. On the other hand, telecom shares were under pressure after India’s top court rejected a plea by mobile carriers seeking corrections of what they called errors in the government’s calculation of their dues. Investors also awaited quarterly results from heavyweight Reliance Industries due later in the day. For the week, however, Sensex lost 0.3% on signs that the global economic recovery might have reached a peak due to a surge in the Delta variant of the coronavirus and rising inflation.",

In business news, India's securities regulator was investigating some of Adani Group's companies for non-compliance with rules.

Meanwhile, India’s Bharat Biotech said that its vaccine, Covaxin, showed 93.4% efficacy against severe coronavirus in late-stage trials.

At the same time, a renewed fall in oil prices weighed on Indian oil and gas heavyweights, with state-owned companies Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Indian Oil Corp falling 2.4% each. In other news, brokerage firm HSBC maintained a 'neutral' rating on Indian equities, but warned that the valuation of the stock market had become a concern now. At the same time, S&P cut India's FY22 GDP growth forecast to 9.5% from 11% projected earlier, saying the damage to private and public sector balance sheets will constrain growth over the next couple of years.",

On the GDP outlook, S&P Global cut its forecasts for some of Asia's countries including India. The nation is projected to grow by 9.5% this year, lower than an earlier forecast of 11%, due to the ongoing outbreak.

        "description": "The Indian rupee depreciated towards 74.0 against the dollar, touching its weakest level since the end of April, as investors turned to the greenback after the US Federal Reserve signaled it would hike interest rates sooner than expected. Elsewhere, concerns that rising crude prices could negatively impact the country's current account deficit mounted. The rupee hit a near two-month high of 72.3 per USD at the end of May, supported by signs that India’s second wave of coronavirus infections is slowing and hopes of a solid economic recovery as more states eased pandemic restrictions. On the economic data front, India's retail price inflation shot up to a six-month high of 6.3% in May, breaching the Reserve Bank of India's target range after five months; while wholesale prices jumped by 12.94% in May, the largest increase since 1998. Earlier this month, the central bank expanded its version of quantitative easing to support economic growth and lowered its FY22 GDP forecast to 9.5%.",

        "description": "The Indian rupee was little-changed at 73.1 against the dollar Friday, hovering around its weakest level since May 19th, amid concerns over rising crude prices. India is one of the top crude importers and an increase in crude negatively impacts the country's current account deficit. Still, the rupee remains relatively strong, having touched a near two-month high of 72.3 per USD at the end of May, amid general dollar weakness and supported by signs that India’s second wave of coronavirus infections is slowing and hopes of a solid economic recovery as more states eased pandemic restrictions. PM Modi announced on June 7th the government would provide free COVID-19 vaccines to all adults, a move that could help accelerate the pace of vaccinations in the country. On the monetary policy front, the Reserve Bank of India last week expanded its version of quantitative easing to support economic growth and lowered its FY22 GDP forecast to 9.5%, down from a previous forecast of 10.5%.",

Meantime, India's finance minister will chair the GST Council meeting where it is likely to discuss a reduction in the tax rate on COVID medicines and ways to make up for a revenue shortfall in various states. The country today saw 186,364 new virus cases, the lowest daily rise since April 14, taking the total tally to 27.56 million. Sentiment was also supported by data showing Americans filing new unemployment claims fell more than expected last week to a 14-month low, while a separate report confirmed US economic growth accelerated at a 6.4% yoy in Q1. Reliance Industries Ltd jumped 3.2%, and Oil and Natural Gas Co added 2.1%.",

FOMC April's meeting minutes showed Wednesday that it might be appropriate in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a tapering plan if the US economy continues to pick up strongly. Turning to coronavirus situations in India, the country today reported 276,110 new virus cases over the last 24 hours, bringing overall caseloads to 25.77 million. Meantime, New Delhi is unlikely to resume major exports of COVID-19 vaccines until at least October as it diverts shots for domestic use, reported Reuters quoting three government sources. In business news, Indian renewable energy company Adani Green Energy said it would buy SoftBank Group Corp-backed SB Energy Holdings for a value of $3.5 billion.  Oil and Natural Gas Co and Sun Pharmaceutical Industry shed 2.2% and 1%, each.",

Investors await key CPI data due later today, with India's retail price inflation seen easing to a three-month low in April, while US consumer prices are forecast to rise by 3.6%, the most in almost a decade. Adding to investor concerns, Moody’s Investors Service slashed India's GDP growth forecast to 9.3% from 13.7% for the fiscal year ending March 2022, due to a deepening COVID crisis. On the economic front, the country's passenger vehicle sales slumped over 10% month on month in April.",

At the same time, new export orders surged to the fastest since last October and buying levels expanded at one of the sharpest rates seen for nine years. Meanwhile, employment declined for a 13th straight month and the weakest in the current sequence of job shedding. On the price front, the rate of input cost inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since July 2014, while selling prices increased to the highest in seven-and-a-half years.

In India, there were 323,144 today, below a record high seen on Monday, with nations including Britain, Germany, and the US pledging aid. Meanwhile, cases in Mumbai, the financial capital of the country, dipped since Maharashtra state entered lockdown earlier this month, according to Reuters. Investors now look at a two-day US Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, beginning later in the day. Castrol India rose 2.9% after the company reported a jump in quarterly profit and revenue.

On the economic data front, India's annual retail inflation jumped to a four-month high of 5.52% in March, while the industrial production contraction deepened in February. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India left interest rates at record-low levels and pledged to maintain its accommodative monetary policy until the prospects of sustained recovery are well secured.",

Traders shrugged off the \"Build Back Better\" plan by US President Joe Biden aimed at rebuilding America’s infrastructure. Locally, India will likely delay deliveries of AstraZeneca virus vaccine doses to the WHO-backed COVAX facility for March and April. Meantime, New Delhi on Wednesday has put a temporary hold on all major exports of the AstraZeneca shot made by the Serum Institute of India to meet domestic demand as infections rise to an over four-month high. In business news,  India’s competition watchdog on Wednesday ordered a probe into a WhatsApp privacy policy update. All major sectors retreated, driven by technology, consumer staples, and energy. Bajaj Finance and Kotak Mahindra Bank dipped 1.9% and 1.6%, each.",

        "description": "India's fiscal deficit widened to a fresh all-time high of INR 12.34 trillion in April-January 2020-21 from INR 9.85 trillion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. That was equivalent to 66.8 percent of the government’s revised estimate for this financial year, compared with 128.5 percent of budget aim in the same period last year. Receipts were unchanged at INR 12.83 trillion, while total expenditure jumped 11 percent to INR 25.17 trillion. The deficit is expected to exceed 8 percent of GDP in the 2020/21 fiscal year that ends in March 2021, compared to initial government estimates of 3.5 percent, mainly due to the coronavirus crisis.",

In local news, India on Thursday announced new rules to regulate content on social media after  Twitter recently ignored government orders to drop content related to farmers’ protests.

At the same time, traders assessed the impact of new guidelines for international arrivals that will take into effect on February 22th, as the government is seeking to curb the spread of mutant variants of COVID-19. In business news,  India Ratings and Research said it does not expect the country's drugmakers to sustain the healthy operating margins reported during the first nine months of the 2021 fiscal year. Investors showed a scant reaction to reports that US industrial output grew by 0.9% mom in January, beating market forecasts of a 0.5% gain. HDFC Co and ICICI Bank dipped 1.5% and 1.4%, each.

        "description": "The BSE SENSEX went up 174 points or 0.3% to 51,491 in early trade on Thursday, hovering around record highs, lifted by upbeat corporate earnings and an expansionary Federal Budget. News that India's exports are expected to continue its positive growth after steps taken by the government also encouraged market sentiment. In the US, meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stressed his commitment to reduce unemployment to multi-decade lows, while signaling little concern about the risk of potentially high inflation or financial-market instability. On the pandemic front, there were 12,760 new infections on Wednesday in India, pushing the total tally to 10.87 million. The energy sector led the gains, followed by consumer non-cyclicals, and financials. Shares of Reliance Industries jumped 2.3%, while Bajaj Finance climbed 1%.",

India reported 12,703 new virus infections in the last 24 hours, continuing to be the second-most-affected globally and ranks 18th among worst-hit nations by active cases. Still, the decline in the index was limited by hopes for large US fiscal stimulus as well as confidence that India's economic recovery from the pandemic will sustain this year amid an expansionary budget for 2021/22. Traders now anticipate the result of the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy meeting on Friday, which expected to hold repo rates on hold at 4%. Indusind Bank and ICICI Bank plunged 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Reliance Industries also fell after saying its unit will sell its interest in certain upstream assets in the Marcellus shale in the US for $250 million to Northern Oil and Gas.",

Output expanded due to marketing efforts, the reopening of some establishments and strengthening demand all supported the increase in sales. At the same time, the growth of total new orders was helped by ongoing price discounting strategies. At the same time, employment declined further, while exports contracted sharply. On the price front, input cost rose for the seventh straight month, due to higher prices of both fuel and materials. Meanwhile, selling prices continued to decline.

Miscellaneous price inflation also eased to 6.60 percent from 6.94 percent.

On the coronavirus front, India's health authorities reported six cases of the new, more infectious variant of coronavirus. However, the daily rise in infections has been slowing since hitting a peak in September. Sensex was on course to book a 15% yearly gain in 2020.",

Official data showed the Indian economy shrank 7.5% yoy in Q3, less than market consensus of an 8.8% drop and after a record 23.9% plunge in Q2. The IMF said Thursday that the country's economy recovered faster than expected in Q3, amid a pickup in the manufacturing sector and an improvement in consumer demand. Investors also hoped for imminent stimulus in the US following talks between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday, while the US Federal Reserve is expected to tweak its guidance of its asset purchase scheme later this month. Shares of UltraTech Cement climbed 5.4%, while Larsen & Toubro added 2.6%.",

Market participants continued to watch the development of a fresh round of fiscal stimulus in India, with Reuters reporting the amount could be about USD 20 billion. The package will be finalized later in the day. It followed Wednesday's announcement of production-linked incentives worth about USD 27 billion over five years for manufacturers in ten sectors.

Traders became confident toward the recovery of the economy after a private report said that virus vaccines could be available by the summer of 2021. Meanwhile, the number of virus cases fell Monday, the first time in over a month, taking its total tally to 7.6 million. Traders now await the final debate between President Donald Trump and his Joe Biden on Thursday. Reuters reported that the debate will feature a mute button to allow each candidate to speak uninterrupted. Shares in industrials, technology, basic materials, and consumer discretionary were mainly higher.",

Also, firms were upbeat about the year-ahead outlook for the first time since April. Meanwhile, the central bank's monetary policy committee announced it would meet at the end of this week, after postponing a rate-setting meeting in September saying three external members of the MPC had not been appointed yet. In its last MPC meeting in August, the RBI left interest rates unchanged, amid rising inflationary pressure.

New orders and new business from abroad dropped at the slowest pace for six months. At the same time, employment declined for the seventh month in a row and at a quicker rate than in August. On the price front, input cost inflation accelerated to a seven-month high, due to higher fuel, meat and vegetable prices. Meanwhile, output charge inflation was little-changed.

Traders shrugged off news that the one-year loan prime rate in China was left unchanged at 3.85% from the previous monthly fixing while the five-year remained at 4.65%. In early trading, most of major sectors fell, led by industrials, consumer non-cyclicals, utilities, and consumer discretionary.

This was the highest reading since March, before the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic. However, it was still below the neutral level, signalling a fifth consecutive decline in private sector business activity. New order dropped at the slowest pace for five months, while the rate of decline in new export orders was among the steepest since September 2014. At the same time, employment fell further albeit at a slower pace. On the price front, both input costs and output charges rose in August. Looking ahead, sentiment was neutral, amid hopes for the passing of COVID-19, market uncertainty and expectations of extended lockdown measures.",

Dealers believe the RBI has been buying dollars in recent weeks to keep the rupee weak, in an attempt to help the export sector through the crisis.

For the week, the rupee booked a 2% gain, its biggest weekly rise since the week ending December 21st, 2018 when it rose 2.4%.",

At the same time, investors continued to monitor the global spike in coronavirus cases, as well as US-China tensions after Washington said it would take action against Chinese software firms that pose national security risks. Data released on Friday following the closing bell showed that the eight core infrastructure industries output contracted by 15% from a year earlier, led by falls in the production of coal, crude oil, natural gas, steel, cement and electricity.",

The latest reading pointed to a fourth straight monthly contraction in factory activity, as some business remained closed amid coronavirus lockdown extensions. Output shrank at a slightly faster rate amid weaker demand conditions. Also, new orders continued to fall markedly, still slower than at the height of the current crisis and export sales dropped further albeit at the softest pace in four months. The job shedding rate was little-changed from June and faster than any recorded prior to the coronavirus pandemic. On the price front, input prices continued to drop, still at the slowest pace in the current four-month sequence of falling cost, and output charges declined further. Lastly, business confidence improved to a five-month high, but still well below the historical average.",

Meanwhile, concerns about India's economic revival persist after several states across the country were forced to re-impose lockdown measures amid a spike in coronavirus cases.",

Meanwhile, a spike in coronavirus cases across India forced many states to re-impose lockdown measures, which could further hurt the country's economic recovery. Earlier in the week, data showed that the country's inflation rate jumped to 6.09% in June, well above the central bank's midpoint target of 4%, while wholesale price deflation eased more than expected.

Sentiment was also lifted by news that the government is working on steps to reduce import dependence on China while boosting domestic manufacturing. Most major sectors moved higher in early trading, with financial stocks, telecommunications, utilities, and healthcare being top gainers. A further rise in oil prices also helped the energy sector jumping more than 1.5%. On an individual share, Reliance Industries surged 1% after the company said it had become net-debt free after raising over INR 1.69 trillion  ($22.15 billion) over the last few weeks through stake sales in its digital arm and a rights issue.",

The world's largest economy is seen contracting by 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate is set to hit 9.3%, while interest rates will probably remain at current levels until 2020 and headline inflation will remain below the central bank's target over that period. On the domestic front, investors remained concerned about the recent spike in the number of new coronavirus cases in India as the government prepares to reopen the economy.",

The latest reading pointed to the second-sharpest deterioration in business activity since the series began 14 years ago, amid the ongoing national lockdown restrictions to help stem the spread of the pandemic. New orders and employment fell sharply and exports collapsed on an unprecedented scale once again. On the price front, input costs dropped at record pace, while output charge deflation eased. Looking ahead, business expectations slumped to their most negative since records began in December 2005 amid forecasts of prolonged economic weakness domestically and overseas.",
